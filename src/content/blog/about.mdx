Hi! I'm Diogo — a Computer Engineering and Economics student at Dartmouth
College with a long-running passion for building things.

I first got into coding when I was nine, after finding a magazine that taught
the basics of programming. I followed along, typed in the examples, broke things,
fixed them, and became enthralled by the idea of of creating something new.
There's even a photo of me holding a sign that my dream job was “software developer.”
That's still the plan.

    width="60%"

I'm currently a full-stack developer at the [DALI Lab at Dartmouth](https://dali.dartmouth.edu),
where I work on real-world digital products with an interdisciplinary team of
designers, product managers, and devs. My academic and technical interests span
compilers, systems, and full-stack development, along with pretty much anything
that pushes me to understand how things work.

When I'm not working on a project, I'm usually out on a run. I've also been
learning to ski (thanks to the New Hampshire winter!), which has been a fun mix
of progress and chaos. And I'm a film buff through and through; follow me
